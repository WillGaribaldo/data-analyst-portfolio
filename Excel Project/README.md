**Project Overview**

In this Excel project, I worked with a dataset containing survey data about individuals and their bike purchasing habits. My tasks included data cleaning, the creation of pivot tables, and the development of an interactive dashboard within Excel. The resulting dashboard serves as a valuable tool for analyzing trends and patterns among bike purchasers, providing a user-friendly means to gain insights into the factors influencing individuals' decisions to purchase bicycles.
