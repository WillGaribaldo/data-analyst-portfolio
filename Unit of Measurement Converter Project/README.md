# Unit Measurement Converter

## Overview 
This Python script converts between different units of measurement: inches, feet, and yards. It showcases various Python programming techniques including user input handling, input validation, and conditional logic.

## Features
- Converts between inches, feet, and yards.
- Validates user input to ensure correct units are entered.
- Provides accurate conversion results with rounding where necessary.
### 1. User Input
The script starts by getting the user input for the starting and desired units of measurement. The input() function is used to capture this data.

### 2. Input Validation
To ensure that the user enters valid units, the script uses conditional statements to check the input against a list of acceptable values.

### 3. Conversion Logic
Depending on the input units, the script prompts the user for a numerical value and performs the appropriate conversion using arithmetic operations. The round() function is used to format the results.


### Supported Units
From Units:
- Inches (in, inch)
- Feet (ft, foot)
- Yards (yd, yard)

To Units:
- Inches (in, inch)
- Feet (ft, foot)
- Yards (yd, yard)
## Conclusion 
This script is a simple yet effective demonstration of handling user input, validating input data, and performing conditional logic in Python. 
This script can be further expanded by adding more units.
