**Project Overview**

As a dedicated Formula 1 fan, I decided to put my SQL skills to the test by diving into a fascinating dataset I discovered on Kaggle. This dataset contained race data spanning all the way back to 1950. After importing it into Microsoft SQL Server, I challenged myself to answer five intriguing questions:

1. Which nationalities have the most wins?
2. Which nationalities have the most F1 drivers?
3. What age do F1 drivers have the most wins?
4. What season in their career do F1 drivers have the most wins?
5. Which country has hosted the most races?

This project allowed me to combine my love for Formula 1 with my SQL expertise, providing valuable insights into the world of Formula 1 racing. Please take a look at "F1 SQL Queries" to see all the queries I created to answer these questions.
