# Simple Python Calculator

This is a simple calculator script written in Python. It can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The script interacts with the user through the command line interface.

## Python Techniques Used
### 1. Function Definitions
The script uses functions to perform each of the four arithmetic operations. Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. Each function takes two arguments and returns the result of the operation.
### 2. User Input
The script takes input from the user using the input() function. It prompts the user to enter their choice of operation and the numbers to be operated on. The input() function reads a line from input and returns it as a string.
### 3. Infinite Loop
An infinite while loop is used to keep the calculator running until the user decides to stop. The loop will continue to execute until a break statement is encountered.
### 4. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements (if, elif, else) are used to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input. The upper() method is used to handle case-insensitive input.
### 5. String Formatting
The script uses string formatting to display the result of the operations. This is done using the print() function.
### 6. Loop Control
The script includes a mechanism to ask the user if they want to perform another calculation. If the user inputs 'no', 'n', or 'Nope', the loop breaks, and the script ends.
## How to Run the Script
